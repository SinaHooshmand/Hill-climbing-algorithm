**Hill Climbing Optimization**
This project implements a hill climbing optimization algorithm to find the maximum value of various test functions. The optimization process is visualized using 3D surface and contour plots. The code is written in Python and utilizes libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib for numerical computations and plotting.

Overview

The hill climbing algorithm is a local search algorithm that continuously moves towards the direction of increasing value (or decreasing cost) to find the optimal solution. This project allows users to optimize functions defined in a 2D space and visualize the optimization trajectory.

Test Functions

The following test functions are implemented in the project:

**Test Function 1**: A complex function that combines cosine and exponential terms.

**Test Function 2**: The peaks function (requires implementation).

**Test Function 3**: A modified version of the Rastrigin function.

**Test Function 4**: A simple quadratic function.

Function Definitions

**Fitness Function**: The main function that evaluates the cost based on the selected test function.

**Peaks Function**: A placeholder for the MATLAB peaks function, which needs to be implemented.

**Installation**

To run the code, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install numpy matplotlib

Usage

**Clone the repository**:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hill-climbing-optimization.git

cd hill-climbing-optimization

Run the optimization script:

python optimization.py

The script will generate plots visualizing the optimization process and display the best solution found.

Results

After running the optimization, the following visualizations will be generated:

**3D Surface Plot**: Displays the objective function surface along with the trajectory of the optimization process.

**Contour Plot**: Shows the contour lines of the objective function with the optimization trajectory overlaid.

**Cost vs Iteration Plot**: Illustrates how the cost changes with each iteration of the optimization process.

Code Explanation

Main Components

**Fitness Function**: Evaluates the cost of a given position based on the selected test function.


**def fitness_function(initial, TestFunctionNo):**

    # Function logic...


**Getting Neighbors**: Generates neighboring positions based on the current position and step size.


**def getneighbours(A, stepsize, ub, lb, TestFunctionNo):**

    # Function logic...

**Optimization Loop**: The main loop that performs the hill climbing optimization until an optimum is found or no improvement can be made.


**while not optimum_found:**

**# Loop logic...**

**Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib to create plots for visualizing the optimization process.

**plt.figure()**

Important Variables

**initial**: The starting position for the optimization.

**ub and lb**: Upper and lower bounds for the search space.

**stepsize**: The step size for generating neighboring positions.

**trajectory**: A list to store the positions and costs at each iteration.
